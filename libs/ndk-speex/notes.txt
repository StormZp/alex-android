This will probably give you a buildable project:

$ android update lib-project --target 3 --path speexjni

Then 

$ cd speexjni
$ ant debug
$ ndk-build  # this tool is in your android-ndk-* directory

If anyone happens to know how to rig things so that the ant build
process does the ndk-build for you, let me know.

To use this speexjni library in an android application, update the
application's project.properties to include a line like this:

android.library.reference.1=../../ndk-speex/speexjni

And use the com.purplefrog.speexjni.SpeexEncoder and SpeexDecoder objects.
